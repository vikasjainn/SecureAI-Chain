# Blockchain-AI Integration for Enhanced Data Security

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the implementation of a cutting-edge research project that explores the seamless integration of Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance data security and privacy. The project aims to create a secure and privacy-preserving model that allows companies to train AI models using a vast amount of consumer data present on the Blockchain, without revealing the users' identities or compromising data integrity

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Data Collection:** The project includes scripts to interact with the Ethereum Blockchain using the Etherscan API to fetch timestamp and block rewards data securely

- **Data Preprocessing:** Data collected from the Blockchain is preprocessed to create a clean and structured dataset for AI model training.

- **Machine Learning Model:** The repository includes a powerful RandomForestRegressor model implemented in Python using scikit-learn for predicting block rewards based on timestamps.

- **Visualization:** Data visualization using matplotlib aids in gaining insights into the relationship between timestamps and block rewards.

- **Future Works:** The project outlines potential future research directions, incorporating homomorphic encryption, federated learning, multi-blockchain compatibility, scalability optimization, and ethical considerations.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/blockchain-ai-integration.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the data collection and preprocessing script to fetch data from the Ethereum Blockchain and create the dataset:
   ```
   python data_collection.py
   ```

4. Next, execute the machine learning model script to train the RandomForestRegressor and predict block rewards:
   ```
   python machine_learning_model.py
   ```
